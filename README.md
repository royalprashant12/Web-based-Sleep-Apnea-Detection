Sleep apnea is a potentially serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly starts and stops. Total of 38,000 People die per year. Medical resources proved that sleep apnea leads to severe heart risks. The symptoms include loud snoring, waking up gasping, having a dry mouth in the morning, or struggling with daytime sleepiness. Simple physical exercises and continuous monitoring of sleep, blood pressure, and sugar levels can control the seriousness of this sleep disorder.
The proposed solution includes a web application that tackles sleep apnea through a multi-pronged approach. Machine learning algorithms analyze user data to estimate sleep apnea risk. 
This app provides the information about the seriousness of the disease.
